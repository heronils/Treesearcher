#[of]:Regex module
Treesearcher assumes that the regex module is installed:

#[c]	pip install regex

More info:
https://pypi.org/project/regex/

Python regular expression docs:
https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html
#[cf]

Treesearcher searches for patterns in textfiles inside of directory trees using regular expressions.

It then creates result files pointing to the search results, plus a table of contents pointing to the result files.

#[l]:This will be the table of contents:_toc.txt

These files, like the file you are currently looking at, are browsable with Code Browser - https://github.com/heronils/Code_Browser_49

Treesearcher will not change the files in which it searches, it will just (try to) open them for reading.

Here is how it works:

#[of]:treesearcher.py
This is the library. Dont touch it.

#[l]:go to treesearcher.py:treesearcher.py


#[cf]
#[of]searches.py:searches.py
In searches.py you define your options and searches.

#[l]:go to searches.py:searches.py
(everything there can be deleted, except the imports)

#[of]Options:Options
First define the root directory and the desired file extensions:

#[of]root directory:root directory
This is the root directory of the directory tree in which you want to search.

#[c]	set_root('path/to/the/rootdirectory')
#[c]	
Todo: allow excluding directories and/or globbing
#[cf]
#[of]:file extensions
These are the extensions of the files you want to consider in your searches.

#[c]	set_fileexts('+.js', '+.css')
#[c]	# will now search for Javascript and CSS files
#[c]	
#[c]	set_fileexts('-.js')
#[c]	# will now just search for CSS files

Todo: extend this to allow regular expression filename filtering.
#[cf]

The cleanup option is optional:

#[of]:cleanup
Removes all *.txt files from the script directory. Those are the result files and the table of contents, and hopefully not your bitcoin-passwords.txt.

#[c]	cleanup()

or

#[c]	cleanup(ask=False)
#[cf]

All options can be defined more than once, in any order, but a root directory and some file extensions need to be defined before calling the first
#[l]:search:#searches.py/Searching

So you can define multiple searches on multiple directory trees in multiple file types.
#[cf]
#[of]Searching:Searching
a search() function defines what you want to search. Its parameter is a dict, mapping search titles to regexes.

#[c]	search({
#[c]		'Check if a p fits better' : r'<br>',
#[c]		'May be wrong written' : r'you´?re?|it´?s',
#[c]		'i should really do that' : r'TODO'
#[c]	})

The search title is used for the name of the file to which the results of this search are written.

The regex defines what to search for. You can use
#[l]:variables:#variables.py
in it.

if you need to use regex flags, write 

#[c]	search({
#[c]		'Title' : [r'regex', regex.DOTALL|regex.MULTILINE],
#[c]		...
#[c]	})

instead of just

#[c]	search({
#[c]		'Title' : r'regex',
#[c]		...
#[c]	})

aka, let the value be a [str,int] instead of a str.

If we call a single key and value of the dict a 'search', then

	every search searches once through the complete
#[l]:	root directory:#searches.py/Options/root directory
	
	All searches inside a single search function are executed parallel,
	using the multiprocessing module.

The functions you call in this module are just setting tasks to be done. The actual execution of the searches is done by the
#[l]:run.py:run.py

Hint: all regexes are compiled using the VERBOSE flag, so you can use free spacing. You can even add code browser sections, links and descriptions inside
of the pattern strings, because the '#' is used as a comment in verbose regexes.
#[cf]
#[cf]
#[of]variables.py:variables.py
In variables.py you can define variables, to be used in patterns. They will be substituted before compiling the regex.

#[l]:go to variables.py:variables.py
(everything there can be deleted)

A variable definition is a normal python assignment

#[c]	p_my_variable = <string>

A variable is called like this

#[c]	{{my variable}}

inside of a string.

Variable definitions must start with 'p_', because you may define Python program logic in the variables.py, using assignments which are not intended to be variables.

Strip the p_ away from the call.

There is also some normalizing done, eg you can write

#[c]	{{ Foo
#[c]	
#[c]	bar  BAZ }}

which will search for a variable

#[c]	p_foo_bar_baz

Example usage:
#[c]
#[c]	p_color='blue'

applied to

#[c]	'the sky is {{color}}'

results in

#[c]	'the sky is blue'

You can also use variables in other  variable values:

#[c]	p_foo_bar_baz = 'foo {{bar}} baz'
#[c]	p_bar = 'bar'

But dont include them recursively because i have not yet implemented a recursion check. Sorry.

#[c]	p_my_var = '{{my var}}'  # do not do that

(Todo: implement it here:)
#[l]:substitute pattern variables in the runpattern:treesearcher.py#do run/compile the runpattern/substitute pattern variables in the runpattern
#[cf]
#[of]:run.py
This is the script which runs the searches defined in the searches.py.

#[l]:go to run.py:run.py

Run this module once you have set your
#[l]:variables:#variables.py
and your
#[l]:searches:#searches.py

When done, the run.py will have created the
#[l]:table of contents:_toc.txt

Navigate to the leafs (aka, into the actual files where the script searched), using ALT + (Arrow Keys) then try

CTRL + SHIFT + (UP or DOWN)

The cursor will be set to the lines matching the end of each search result.

Hint: press CTRL + F2 to highlight the whole line, should it wrap.
